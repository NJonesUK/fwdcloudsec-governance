# Conflict of Interest

## Purpose

The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect this tax-exempt
Association's interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or
arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of
the Association or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This
policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and
federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and
charitable organizations.

## Definitions

**Interested Person**: Any director, principal officer, or member of a committee
with governing board delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect financial
interest, as defined below, is an interested person.

**Financial Interest**: A person has a financial interest if the person has,
directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:
1. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the
   Association has a transaction or arrangement,
1. A compensation arrangement with the Association or with any entity or
   individual with which the Association has a transaction or arrangement, or
1. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation
   arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Association is
   negotiating a transaction or arrangement.

Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or
favors that aren’t insubstantial. A financial interest isn’t necessarily a
conflict of interest. Under Section 3, subsection 2 of this Article, a person
who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the
appropriate governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest
exists.

## Procedures

### Duty to Disclose

In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested
person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the
opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of
committees with governing board delegated powers considering the proposed
transaction or arrangement.

### Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists

After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any
discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing board or
committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed
and voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a
conflict of interest exists.

### Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest

1. An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board or
   committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the
   meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or
   arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.
1. The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate,
   appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to
   the proposed transaction or arrangement.
1. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall
   determine whether the Association can obtain with reasonable efforts a more
   advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would
   not give rise to a conflict of interest.
1. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement isn’t reasonably possible
   under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing board
   or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors
   whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Association's best interest,
   for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity
   with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to
   enter into the transaction or arrangement.

### Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy

1. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member
   has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall
   inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an
   opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
1. If, after hearing the member's response and after making further
   investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or
   committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible
   conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective
   action.

## Records of Proceedings

The minutes of the governing board and all committees with board-delegated
powers shall contain:

1. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a
   financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of
   interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine
   whether a conflict of interest was present, and the governing board's or
   committee's decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.
1. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating
   to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including
   any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of
   any votes taken in connection with the proceedings.

## Compensation

1. A voting member of the governing board who receives compensation, directly or
   indirectly, from the Association for services is precluded from voting on
   matters pertaining to that member's compensation.
1. A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation
   matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the
   Association for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to
   that member's compensation.
1. No voting member of the governing board or any committee whose jurisdiction
   includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or
   indirectly, from the Association, either individually or collectively, is
   prohibited from providing information to any committee regarding compensation.

## Annual Statements

Each director, principal officer and member of a committee with governing board
delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person:
1. Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,
1. Has read and understands the policy,
1. Has agreed to comply with the policy, and
1. Understands the Association is charitable and in order to maintain its
   federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish
   one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.

## Periodic Reviews

To ensure the Association operates in a manner consistent with charitable
purposes and doesn't engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt
status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a
minimum, include the following subjects:

1. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on
   competent survey information, and the result of arm's length bargaining.
1. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management
   organizations conform to the Association's written policies, are properly
   recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services,
   further charitable purposes and don't result in inurement, impermissible
   private benefit, or in an excess benefit transaction.

## Use of Outside Experts

When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII, the
Association may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are
used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its responsibility for
ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.

# Indemnification

## General

To the full extent authorized under the laws of the State of Delaware, the
Assocation shall indemnify any director, officer, employee, or agent, or
former member, director, officer, employee, or agent of the Association, or any
person who may have served at the Association’s request as a director or
officer of another Association (each of the foregoing members, directors,
officers, employees, agents, and persons is referred to in this Article
individually as an “indemnitee”), against expenses actually and necessarily
incurred by such indemnitee in connection with the defense of any action, suit,
or proceeding in which that indemnitee is made a party by reason of being or
having been such member, director, officer, employee, or agent, except in
relation to matters as to which that indemnitee shall have been adjudged in
such action, suit, or proceeding to be liable for negligence or misconduct in
the performance of a duty. The foregoing indemnification shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an indemnitee may be entitled under any
bylaw, agreement, resolution of the Board of Directors, or otherwise.

## Expenses

Expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in defending a civil
or criminal action, suit, or proceeding may be paid by the Association in
advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding, if
authorized by the Board of Directors, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder.

## Insurance
The Association may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who
is or was a member, director, officer, employee, or agent against any liability
asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity
or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the Association
would have the power or obligation to indemnify such person against such
liability under this Article.
